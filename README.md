# üìù Practice Makes Perfect


Feel free to use the test.py file located in the root directory to practice the concepts you've learned throughout the book. This file includes exercises designed to reinforce your understanding and help you become more comfortable with Python programming. Happy coding!

# üéÆ Final Project: UNO Game:

As a culmination of your learning journey, you will build a simple text-based UNO game. This project will help you apply the concepts and skills you've gained throughout the book.

# Project Overview:

n this UNO game, players will take turns drawing cards, playing their cards, and trying to get rid of all their cards before their opponents do. The game will follow standard UNO rules, including special cards such as skip, reverse, and draw two. You'll implement the game logic, user interactions, and basic error handling.

I have the source code for this project. Once you have completed it and tried it yourself, you can request the source code
